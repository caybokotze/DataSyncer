# Data Syncer #

Data syncer is a data syncing engine developed to sync data betweeen different databases in real time. It has a windows service implementation to take care of starting the syncing service every minute.

*Currently I am working to make this repository a more general solution as it was developed with a specific problem and client in mind when originally created.*
